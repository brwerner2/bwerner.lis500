            		<h2>Will Portz</h2>
            			<p>I'm an Information Science student at the University of Wisconsin–Madison and an aspiring cybersecurity professional with a strong focus on security operations, monitoring, and system resilience. I currently work as a Computer Operator at Brightstar Lottery in Madison, Wisconsin, where I assist in the daily operation of critical computer systems. In this role, I support operational continuity by executing daily system checklists, generating and validating system reports, assisting with recovery activities, and following formal escalation procedures to restore normal operations when issues arise. This experience has given me hands-on exposure to production environments, operational discipline, and the importance of reliability in mission-critical systems.</p>
						<p>Alongside my professional work, I’ve built a solid foundation in cybersecurity through both academic study and industry-recognized certifications. I hold the CompTIA Security+ certification and have completed the Splunk Search Expert Specialization, including Search Expert 101, 102, and 103. Through this training, I’ve developed practical skills in log analysis, SPL querying, and extracting actionable insights from large-scale security and operational data.</p>
						<p>My academic background in Information Science emphasizes the intersection of technology, data, and human systems. I’m particularly interested in how organizations design secure, resilient infrastructures and how security teams balance detection speed, accuracy, and recovery under real-world constraints.</p>
						<p>I took LIS 500: Code and Power because I want to better understand how code and technical design decisions shape power, access, and control within society. As someone pursuing a career in cybersecurity, I’ve seen how systems enforce rules behind the scenes, determining who has access, how information flows, and how failures or threats are handled. This class offers a chance to critically examine those dynamics and think more intentionally about the power embedded in technical systems.</p>
