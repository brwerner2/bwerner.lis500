These biases, often taught subconsciously by a society, are how we as humans make quick decisions and opinions on people even if these initial feelings are not what our values would reflect.</font></p>

Overall this test, with its quick timing and easy controls, aims to reveal the unconscious implicit biases a person might have when making automatic split decisions, and with a variety of different tests, it can provide a test taker a comprehensive overview of where their biases are stronger and weaker.</font></p>
