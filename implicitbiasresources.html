					<p><font size = "3">Implicit bias is a term that refers to a person's unconscious automatic associations, stereotypes, and system 1 processing. These biases, often taught subconsciously by a society, are how we as humans make quick decisions and opinions on people even if these initial feelings are not what our values would reflect.</font></p>
					<p><font size = "3">An implicit bias test, as run by Harvard University, is a tool to measure this implicit bias by presenting the test taker with a set of people and words and measuring how strong certain associations 'click' in comparison to others. Overall this test, with its quick timing and easy controls, aims to reveal the unconscious implicit biases a person might have when making automatic split decisions, and with a variety of different tests, it can provide a test taker a comprehensive overview of where their biases are stronger and weaker.</font></p>

					<p><font size = "3">Intersectionality, the creation of Kimberlé Crenshaw, is a concept that explores how the totality of a person moves through the world. In sociology and data analysis there is a whole industry of grouping and dissecting people based on their societal characterizations, such as age, race, gender, and sexuality. However, through intersectionality we can see how these characterizations only tell a part of the story, and it is the intersection of these characterizations that actually tells the story of how a person experiences power and oppression. Overall, intersectionality provides a nuanced approach to societal identity, encompassing all aspects of what makes a person themselves and highlighting the distinctive ways their intersecting traits shape their perspectives.</font></p>
